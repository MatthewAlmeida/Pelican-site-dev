Experience
##########

Ph.D. Candidate, Research Assistant - University of Massachusetts Boston
========================================================================

*Sept. 2016 - Present*

As a Ph.D. Candidate in applied machine learning at the Knowledge Discovery Lab 
in UMB’s CS dept, my focus is on modeling real-world datasets with deep neural 
networks in Python. Research projects have included: modeling human activity 
recognition with wearable accelerometers (from perspectives including: labeling 
uncertainty, ablation studies with respect to number of sensors / handedness of 
individuals, effects of subject-specific distributional differences on 
modeling), fall risk modeling in older adults, crime forecasting, music genre 
recognition, and stream flow prediction for river flooding. Supervised 
undergraduate lab assistants and mentored junior Ph.D. students in data 
science methodology and programming best practice.

Ph.D. Intern, Data Science - Indigo Ag
=======================================

*June 2019 - August 2019*

Worked with Indigo’s data science team to design, implement, train, and evaluatea
an irrigation status model for cropland in the continental US, trained on 
multispectral satellite imagery (to 30m resolution) and associated weather
data. Used Python, AWS, SQL, and XGBoost. Results published as an abstract 
at `AGU 2019 <https://bit.ly/2xsPyvj>`_. Presentation slides available at 
LinkedIn URL above.

AVP - Catastrophe Modeling
===========================

*November 2005 - September 2016*

Assisted the decision-making of corporate and underwriting staff by providing 
statistical risk metrics quantifying the company’s risk exposure to hurricanes 
and earthquakes. Responsible (with team) for populating and maintaining data
store (MS SQL) of direct property building data, for use in risk modeling and 
accumulation management. Designed, developed, and maintained internal tools to 
automate catastrophe department workflow and reporting using C# and SQL. 
Identified and remedied inefficiencies in existing analyst workflows and 
screened future changes to procedures for potential issues. Suggested 
alternatives and coded solutions. Was personally responsible for the intake 
and processing of another multinational property insurer’s in force policy data 
following a major acquisition. Moved up in the company several times, finishing 
as AVP – Catastrophe Modeling (2014-2016). Worked as a Senior Catastrophe 
Analyst from 2010-2014 and as Catastrophe Analyst from 2005-2010.
